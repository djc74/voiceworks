Voice is nothing new. Voice is what we have used since the day we were born to communicate. What IS new is the way technology is being used to accept voice commands. Suddenly the tech is working around how we have spoken and interacted with one another since the beginning of time.

Voice Works is about supporting you to harness this new technology and discovering how you can use it to benefit your brand, business or organisation. We can help you with anything from helping you come up with an idea, to recording, creating and scheduling your flash briefing

We bring a vast amount of experience from our broadcasting backgrounds to the voice tech space. Between us we create five flash briefings available via Alexa-enabled devices and we want to share our expertise and knowledge with you.
