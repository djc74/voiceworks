Voice is nothing new. Voice is what we have used since the day we were born to communicate. What is new is the way technology is being used to accept voice commands. Suddenly the tech is working around how we have spoken and interacted with one another since the beginning of time.

Voice Works is about supporting you to harness this new technology and discovering how you can use it to benefit your brand, business or organisation. We bring a vast amount of experience from our broadcasting backgrounds to the voice tech space. Between us we create five flash briefings available via Alexa-enabled devices and we want to share our expertise and knowledge with you.

Ever the news journalists, we want to bring the latest voice news to your inbox every week. We will also let you know about events and meet-ups, where we are speaking and how you can get in touch to discuss voice experience creation and consultancy.
